Module 4 Challenge


Analysis of the PyCity School District shows that they are 15 school district with 39,170 students and a total budget of $2.46M. 
Of the 15 schools, 7 are district schools while the remaining 8 are charter schools.
For the district as a whole, 65.2% of students are passing both math and reading, with a larger percent of students passing reading (85.8% vs 74.9% in math). 
Charter schools are acheiving higher passing percentages across all categories vs district schools, however higher school budget does not play significant factor as lower budget per capita are shown to have a higher passing percentages.

Conclusion 1) 

Charter schools have significantly fewer students (avg 1524 students) than district schools (avg 3853 students).
This could potentially mean that students have a lower student:teacher ratio and could be a potential reason for higher passing percentages.


Conclusion 2)

Every schools reading score is greater than there math score. There may be a need to review the math curriculum to ensure students are able to excel in all categories.
